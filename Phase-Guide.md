# Phase Guide: Five-Stage Penetration Testing Methodology

This document provides a high-level overview of the five phases used in this project.

---

## 1. Reconnaissance
Purpose: Gather preliminary information about the target environment.

Activities:
- Lab verification
- ARP discovery
- Ping sweeps
- Passive OSINT and DNS review

---

## 2. Scanning
Purpose: Identify live hosts, services, and potential entry points.

Activities:
- Port scanning (TCP/UDP)
- Version detection
- Service enumeration
- Scripted scanning

---

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment
Purpose: Validate potential weaknesses and map them to known CVEs.

Activities:
- Manual review of services
- Vulnerability mapping and triage
- Automated scanning integration
- Risk scoring using CVSS

---

## 4. Exploitation
Purpose: Validate real-world impact of identified vulnerabilities.

Activities:
- Exploit selection and execution
- Privilege escalation
- Post-exploitation enumeration

---

## 5. Reporting
Purpose: Document results, risks, and remediation recommendations.

Artifacts:
- Executive summary
- Technical analysis
- Evidence repository
- Final PDF report
