The assessment is strictly limited to predefined IP ranges and systems.

## In-Scope Targets

- VirtualBox Host Network: `192.168.56.0/24`
- Specific target machine(s): Defined in the reconnaissance branch.

## Out-of-Scope

- Any public network
- Systems outside the target subnet
- Denial-of-Service attacks
- Attacks impacting system stability without explicit testing justification

## Engagement Rules

- Only document and validate findings; avoid destructive exploitation.
