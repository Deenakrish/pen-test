# Penetration Testing Methodology

This project implements a five-phase methodology inspired by industry-recognized frameworks such as:

- PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
- NIST SP 800-115
- OSSTMM

## Applied Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   Collect environmental information, identify hosts, and establish understanding of the attack surface.

2. **Scanning**  
   Enumerate ports, services, banners, and system profiles to identify entry points.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**  
   Map vulnerabilities, validate exposure, and score risk.

4. **Exploitation**  
   Perform controlled exploitation to measure impact and confirm root-cause vulnerabilities.

5. **Reporting**  
   Deliver structured information about findings, risks, evidence, and remediation steps.

This methodology ensures completeness, traceability, and professional reporting.
